Basic Tiny chat within groups.

create a chatroom for each buddypress group, I make two version: bp-group-tinychat and bp-group-tinychat-pro, the difference is: with pro version, users will automatically be logged into the chat room with nickname is wordpress user's name. Just 5$ to buy pro version. just buy one times, when new version available, don't buy it again, just send me your email and i will sent it free for you.
Once installed, activate Tiny Chat in the group admin area (or during group creation).
